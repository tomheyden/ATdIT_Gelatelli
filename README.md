## Installation
For information on how to install the programm and get it ready-to-use refer to the [Installation Guide](Documentation/Installation%20Guide.md).

## Features

### Production Planning
* Notification when a specific ingredient is running low
* Calendar/list for scheduling when each ice cream flavor should be produced
* Automatic warning if production planning could be more efficient (e.g., if a product is close to its expiration date)

### Efficient Ingredient Usage
* Automatic deduction of inventory items by scanning their barcode
* Warning when an ingredient is running low
* Notification when ingredients are about to expire, along with suggested ice cream flavors to use them in

### Efficient Ingredient Procurement
* Ability to order ingredients directly through the system
* Price comparison of products before ordering
* Notification when a specific ingredient is on sale
* Ability to track inventory using barcodes/QR codes

### Criteria-Based Prediction
* Prediction of ice cream demand based on weather, holidays, events, trends from past sales and social media trends
* Sorting based on contribution margin

### Ice Cream Consumption Tracking
* Smart scales placed under each ice cream flavor to track consumption
* Display of remaining quantity for each ice cream flavor
* Warning when an ice cream flavor is running low

### Data Analysis for Trend Detection
* Anonymized analysis of IoT data to detect trends in ice cream flavors
